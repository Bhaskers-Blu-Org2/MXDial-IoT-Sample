# MXDial IoT DevKit Sample

In this PaaS demo solution you will setup and connect an Azure IoT DevKit device to the Azure IoT Hub and view sensor readings in a custom web application. The purpose of the demo is to showcase how the Azure IoT Hub is able to process messages in real-time from tangible devices. The demo also covers communicating to the device via Direct Methods and integrating to 3rd party APIâ€™s.

This repository contains a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your own instance of the demo. 

## Introduction

The source code in this repository contains the following:
* React Frontend Web Application
* .NET WebApi
* C++ Arduino Project

This tutorial will focus on setting up the required Azure services and consuming them within each of the applications to create an e2e solution that is focussed around the Azure IoT Hub. The below image outlines the high-level architecture of the solution.

## Environment Setup
### Prerequisites 
1. Windows 10
1. IoT DevKit MX Device
1. Visual Studio 2017 or later ([Link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)).
1. Azure subscription ([Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)).
1. Twitter account ([Link](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup))
1. Yarn Package Manager ([Link](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable))

All additional software that is required will be installed via the Install IoT DevKit Environment step later in the guide.

### Download Lab Material

If you have git installed, you can run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/MXDial-IoT-Sample.git`

Alternatively, you can download the material directly: [Download Material](https://github.com/Microsoft/MXDial-IoT-Sample/archive/master.zip)

### Install IoT DevKit Environment

To use the installer, you will need to [Download](https://devkitfiles.blob.core.windows.net/github/devkit_) and extract the `devkit_install_win.zip` file. 

Once completed, run `install.cmd` from the extracted directory.

>IMPORTANT!: This version of the installer was used at the time of development. For the latest environment setup or if you wish to complete this manually, follow the [Install Development Environment](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/#install-development-environment) online guide.


## Cloud resource setup

### Create Azure Web App
The Azure App Service is an integrated offering for building and hosting web apps.

1. From the Azure Portal, go to the **Create a resource** option.
1. Search for ++Web App++.
1. Select the first result and click the **Create** button.
1. Provide the required information:
  * App name: mxchip-<your initials>.
  * Create a new resource group with the name: `mxchip-lab-<your initials>`.
  * Location: `West US`.
  * OS: Windows.
1. Click on App service plan/Location.
1. Click **Create** New.
1. Provide the required information:
  * App Service plan name: mxchip-lab-<your initials>.
  * Location: `West US`.
  * Pricing Tier: S1 Standard.
1. Click **OK** to save the new App service plan.
1. Click **Create** to deploy the service. This step might take a few moments.

### Azure IoT Hub Setup (also consumer group)
* Setup resource 
* instructions on how to add consumer group called MXChip
* Get the connection script

### Tweeter setup

## Deploying web application
### update all app settings
### Run script to build frontend and move to wwwroot

1. Open a **Terminal** window and navigate to `frontend/mx`.
1. Run the following commands:
  * yarn install
  * npm run build
1. Create a **wwwroot** directory in `backend/MXApi`.
1. Copy the contents of the **build** directory to `backend/MXApi/wwwroot`

### Deploy to Azure from Visual Studio
For the purposes of our lab, we'll be deploying directly from Visual Studio.

1. Open **Visual Studio** from the Start Menu.
1. Click **Open Project/Solution** and select `backend\MxDialBackend.sln`.
1. Click on the current connected account in the top right corner of Visual Studio.
1. Click on Account Settings....
1. Click on the Sign out button.
1. Click on the Sign in button.
1. Login with the same credentials as you used for Azure.

  > [!NOTE] This will connect Visual Studio to your Azure subscription.
1. Click **Close**.
1. Right-click the MxApi project.
1. Click **Publish**.
1. Mark the option Select Existing.
1. Click **Publish**.
1. Select the Web App previously created.
1. Click **OK** and wait for the deployment to complete. This step might take a few minutes.

## Deploying MX chip 
### connect to wifi
### update endpoint to get device id
### update password to access above endpoint (if we still have auth).
### deploy code

## Testing solution
### link to script documentation.
